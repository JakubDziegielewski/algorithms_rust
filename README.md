# Algotihms in Rust

My implementation of several algorithms using Rust.

##Polynomials multiplication
3 implementations of multiplication of polynomials- naive, the most straightforward one (big O notation: O(n^2)), and two using divide and conquer design paradigm, one of which is also naive (O(n^2), and one is optimal (O(n^log2(3))
