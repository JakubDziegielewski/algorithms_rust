# Algorithms in Rust

My implementation of several algorithms using Rust.

## Counting sort
Method of sorting non-negative integers smaller than given N; O(n)

##Merge sort
Implementation of merge sort; O(n log(n))

## Polynomial multiplication
3 implementations of multiplication of polynomials- naive, the most straightforward one (big O notation: O(n^2)), and two using divide and conquer design paradigm, one of which is also naive (O(n^2), and one is optimal (O(n^log2(3))

## Quick sort

3 implementations of quick sort algorithm; O(n log(n))
